It's getting dangerous out there, it's all over the news, IT security is simply no longer something one can ignore. 

In this session we'll model all the threats to a use case web application powered by a Java back end.
We’ll debate, but also have fun, state the obvious and debunk a few security myths:

* Yes, strong security come at price, it requires a brain,
* No, strong security does not mean crappy user experience,
* No, there is no silver bullet, be pragmatic, 
* Yes, they are many standards and frameworks (saml, oauth, jwt, 2-way-ssl ...) 
  ** we'll showcase a few and debate when to choose what
* Yes, SELinux and the Java SecurityManager can be your friends
* Yes, Security needs to be baked into all your automation and continuous integration. Secret Management is key 

Remember, It’s not a question of 'if' but 'when' you’ll be hacked, at the end of this session, 
you’ll decide for yourself if it's really time for this simple web app to go live !
