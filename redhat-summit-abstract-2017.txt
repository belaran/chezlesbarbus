* Abstract: 2500c

It's getting dangerous out there, it's all over the news, IT security is simply no longer something one can ignore. 

In this session we'll model all the threats to a ... very simple REST API; a simple REST API powered by JBoss EAP leveraging KeyCloak Identity and Access Management

In this session we’ll debate, but also have fun, state the obvious and debunk a few security myths:

Yes, strong security come at price, it requires a brain,
No, strong security does not mean crappy user experience,
No, there is no silver bullet, be pragmatic, 
Yes, they are many standards and frameworks: saml, oauth, jwt, 2-way-ssl
we'll showcase them and debate when to choose what
Yes, SELinux and the Java SecurityManager can be your friends
Yes, Security needs to be baked into all your automation and continuous integration. Secret Management is key (we’ll have a quick look at ansible vault for this).

Remember, It’s not a question of 'if' but 'when' you’ll be hacked, at the send of this session, you’ll decide for yourself if it's really time for your REST API to go live !
