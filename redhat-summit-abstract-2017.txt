* Title:

* Abstract: Hairy Security: the many threats to one simple REST API

It's getting dangerous out there, it's all over the news, IT security is simply no longer something one can ignore. 

In this session we'll model all the threats to a very simple REST API; a simple REST API powered by JBoss EAP leveraging KeyCloak Identity and Access Management. We’ll debate, but also have fun, state the obvious and debunk a few security myths:

* Yes, strong security come at price, it requires a brain,
* No, strong security does not mean crappy user experience,
* No, there is no silver bullet, be pragmatic, 
* Yes, they are many standards and frameworks (saml, oauth, jwt, 2-way-ssl ...) we'll showcase a few and debate when to choose what
* Yes, SELinux and the Java SecurityManager can be your friends
* Yes, Security needs to be baked into all your automation and continuous integration. Secret Management is key 

Remember, It’s not a question of 'if' but 'when' you’ll be hacked, at the send of this session, you’ll decide for yourself if it's really time for this simple REST API to go live !
