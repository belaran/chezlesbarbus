* Title:

* Abstract: 2500c

With the increasing numbers of DoS attacks and password stole, security is simply no longer something one can ignore. But how to approach such a broad and difficult topic ? Especially from the point of view of a JEE application ? How can both JBoss EAP and its security feature (Keycloak) protect your application ?

In this session we’ll debate, but also have fun, state the obvious and debunk a few security myths:

No, there is no such thing as a good password; keep yourself away from the password business, use an Identity provider (we’ll have a look at JBoss Keycloak for that).

Yes, strong security can also lead to fantastic user experience. No, there is no silver bullet, be pragmatic, mix various standards and frameworks (we’ll introduce SAML and OAuth2).

Yes, Security needs to be baked into all your automation and continuous integration. Secret Management is key (we’ll have a quick look at ansible vault for this).

It’s not a question of 'if' but 'when' you’ll be hacked (SELinux and the Java SecurityManager will be your best friends).

Then, you’ll decide for yourself if it's really time for you app to go live !
