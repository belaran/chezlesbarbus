Once upon a time, architects were meant to design new buildings and urbanization had something to do with solving traffic jams and created new taxes (and not about any type of Sim City video game...).  Then some IT guys came in with the title "Architects" or "Urbanists" on their business cards and civil engineers started to get a little confused... Now real estate started to get tired of the green washed buildings luring in everything that could be labelled "smart" whether it is related to a city or home, and now people are using "blockchain" in construction talks!

Thus we are glad to offer the first IT versus Concrete challenge: Who does it better?

On the right, coming from a leading nationwide construction firm, Benjamin!  And on the left, we have Romain, an experience software engineer.  You will be the judge, jury and executioner as they battle over this presentation, covering both common ground and the radical differences between the two industries.  Topped and spiced with horror stories from the field.  The audience will choose who does it better (or worse).
