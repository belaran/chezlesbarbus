Once upon a time, architects were meant to design new buildings and urbanization had something to do with solving traffic jam and creating new taxes (and that was not about any Sim City video game…). And then some IT guys came with the title Architects or Urbanists on their business cards and civil engineers started to get a little baffled… Now real estate being tired of green washed buildings is luring into everything that could be labelled smart whether it is a city or a home and now people are talking about Blockchain in construction talks!

Thus we are glad to offer the first IT versus concrete challenge : who does it better ?

On the right from a leading nationwide construction firm comes Benjamin, and on the left and Romain, an experienced software engineer. You are to be judge, jury and executioner after they both battle over this presentation about both common ground and radical difference between the two industry, topped and spiced up with horror stories from the field, so that the audience can figure who does it better (or worse) ?
