Hairy Security: your new business partner (or crasher!)

So you had this great idea for an app, even built a proof of concept around it
and, of course, baked it on top of JBoss and RHEL – what else ?  Time is
flying and everyone wants it to go live asap. But did you give a thought to
the
reat business enabler that is Security ?

In this session we’ll debate, have fun, state the obvious and debunk a few
security myths
* No, there is no such thing as one good password
* Yes, you do need an Identity provider,
** we’ll have a look at JBoss Keycloak for that
* Yes, strong security can also lead to fantastic user experience
* No, silver bullet, be pragmatic, mix various standards and frameworks
** here we’ll introduce SAML and OAuth2
* Yes, Security needs to be baked in all your automation and continuous
integration
* Secret Management is key , we’ll have a quick look at ansible vault for this
* It’s not a question of 'if' but 'when' you’ll be hacked
** here SELinux and the Java SecurityManager will be your best friends

Then, you’ll decide for yourself if it's really time for you app to go live !
